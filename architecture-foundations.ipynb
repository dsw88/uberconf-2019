    "# Architecture Foundations: Styles and Patterns\n",
    "This notebook contains the notes from the *Architecture Foundations: Styles and Patterns* talk by Neal Ford at UberConf 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this talk, Neal showed a taxonomy he created of architectural patterns. He broke these into two main branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technical partitioning architectures\n",
    "* Domain partitioning architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "He commented how technical partitioning architectures achieve achieve separations of concerns, but that they have fallen out of favor recently. He commented how it is difficult to make changes in these architectures because many people must be involved in a single change.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then gave some overviews of various architectural patterns and their advantages. He was careful to say multiple times that architectural patterns are always about trade-offs. You achieve some particular benefit at the cost of problems somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layered Architecture\n",
    "Neal said this is the classic technical partitioning architecture. In this pattern, the application is separated into layers, such as the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Presentation\n",
    "* Business\n",
    "* Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer can only be called by the layer immediately above it. This is about separation of concerns, the idea being that if you have to replace a layer (like your database in the persistence layer), then only that layer and the layer above it need to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neal said the downside to this architecture is that making changes that affect all the layers (like adding new features) happen far more often than needing to replace an entire layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplicity\n",
    "* Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microkernel Architecture\n",
    "Also known as the *plugin architecture*. This pattern is composed of a core system that is augmented by plugins. Browsers implement this pattern and it works well there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neal said an example of improperly applying this pattern is Eclipse. He said that as long as the plugins don't need to talk to each other, this pattern works great. It becomes incredibly complicated when plugins need to start communicating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples where this fits is the domain of insurance claims processing. You can have core processing logic that is augmented by laws and rules for each state where you do business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity\n",
    "* Simplicity\n",
    "* Cost\n",
    "* Adaptability\n",
    "* Evolvability\n",
    "* Agility\n",
    "* Testability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-Driven Architecture\n",
    "In this pattern, communication between systems is done via message queue. There are two main topologies of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Broker topology - Events go to queues, which are then directly handled by event processors.\n",
    "* Mediator topology - Similar to broker but all events go through an *event mediator*.\n",
    "    * Mediator posts to individual channels, and takes care of workflow requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling is difficult in this pattern. It is the architect's responsibility to ensure that error handling is built into the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity\n",
    "* Agility\n",
    "* Fault-tolerance\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "* Performance\n",
    "* Elasticity\n",
    "* Adaptability\n",
    "* Evolvability\n",
    "\n",
    "### ESB-driven SOA\n",
    "Neal didn't have much good to say about this pattern. He said it is very hard to make changes because it is technically partitioned across multiple systems; you have to get an army to coordinate for any change. It also is a very complex architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said this pattern was a product of the times: People wanted to get to a point where they had almost 100% reuse, snapping together systems with little \"lego\" pieces of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern achieves reuse at the *high* cost of increased coupling. Neal said there is always a tradeoff between reuse and coupling, and you have to make sure you get more benefits from the reuse than you do drawbacks from the increased coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integration, Integration\n",
    "* Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serverless\n",
    "It's interesting to me that Neal put this as an \"architecture pattern\". I would probably personally consider this an infrastructure implementation detail, since you can implement almost any of the other architectural patterns in a serverless environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neal talked only about Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS). He said he's interested in serverless but doesn't feel like it's ready for prime-time yet because there are a lot of edge cases to be aware of. I'm not sure I agree with him on this; everything has edge cases and behaviors to be aware of. I do agree with him that people need to be aware of them before going to production on a serverless infrastructure, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "* Agility\n",
    "* Lack of infrastructure\n",
    "* Discrete functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular Monolith\n",
    "Unlike the monolithic layered architecture, this monlithic architecture is *domain-partitioned*. You still have multiple components deployed in a single executable, but they are isolated from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agility\n",
    "* Modularity\n",
    "* Deployability\n",
    "* Restructurability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices\n",
    "This architecture is domain-partitioned, and Neal said it took a lot of inspiration from the Domain-Driven Design book. He also said it incorporated lessons learned from SOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is characterized by a rejection of reuse, it prefers loose-coupling instead. Unlike ESBs, it is *protocol-aware*, meaning all microservices need to speak the same protocol (usually HTTP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Service components in this pattern are smaller. The goal is **not** trying to keep things very small, however. The goal is to *capture a bounded context*. One of the biggest mistakes people make with this architecture is going overly-granular in their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared concerns in this architecture can be accomplished via patterns such as the sidecar pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neal said you want to avoid implementing distributed transactions in this architecture. If you find you need to do that, he said it may be symptomatic that you need to combine several of your microservices into the right bounded context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Events can be used heavily in the microservice architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity\n",
    "* Agility\n",
    "* Fault tolerance\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "* Testability\n",
    "* Deployability\n",
    "* Evolvability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service-based architecture\n",
    "Neal said this pattern is like microservices, but with two pragmatic tradeoffs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced service granularity.\n",
    "    * Multiple domains can still live together in the same service\n",
    "* Shared data stores between services.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is often implemented by people struggling to move from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. In many cases, at least initially, the above compromises must be made in order to move forward. These compromises come at the cost of increased coupling and difficulty in making schema changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ArchUnit\n",
    "Someone asked the quesion of how can an architect be sure that their architectures are being followed. He talked about using *architectural fitness functions*, which essentially refers to various automated techniques for evaluating architectural pattern success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, he points to [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) as a way to perform certain types of architecture automated tests against Java applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "I liked this talk. While I don't have practical experience with all these patterns, I found myself nodding my head at a lot of what he said about layered architecture and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd be interested in reading his book [Building Evolutionary Architectures](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491986360)"
