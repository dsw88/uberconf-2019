    "# Grokking Generics\n",
    "I attended the session *Grokking Generics* by Daniel Hinojosa at *UberConf 2019*. He did a great job covering some of the more arcane aspects of generics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't take many notes because most of it was running code examples and I was focused on understanding it. However, Daniel has posted the code he demoed to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/dhinojosa/generics-study. I highly recommend looking at some of the unit tests there that illustrate how things like *super* and *extends* in generics behave."
