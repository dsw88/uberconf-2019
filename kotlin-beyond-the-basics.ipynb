    "# Kotlin: Beyond the Basics\n",
    "Ken Kousen\n",
    "\n",
    "A meandering tour of various parts of the language and platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Went through `antarctica.kt` from his cookbook github repository \n",
    "\n",
    "Showed example of GraalVM compiled Kotlin program down to native executable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kotlin `scripts` have an extension of `.kts` and don't need to have a main() function\n",
    "\n",
    "Superclass of all Kotlin objects is not `Object`, it is `Any`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using nullable variables\n",
    "In a nullable variable, the `!!` operator asserts that the value is not null. This is not safe and should not normally be used. The `?.` operator is the 'safe' operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "`var` with a nullable type that could be accessed by multiple threads can't do a smart cast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nothing Type\n",
    "`val abc = null` infers to a special type `Nothing?`. This is a special class in Kotlin that has no members and can't be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Nothing` is a subclass of every type, which is super strange. This means you can assign `Nothing?` to `String?`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Overloading\n",
    "Supports a limited form of operator overloading with `operator functions`. The operators (+, -, etc.) will delegate to operator functions of a certain name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "operator fun Complex.plus(c: Complex): Complex = this.add(c) // Extension function to the Complex class with an operator function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delegates\n",
    "See Kotlin \"Delegation Pattern document\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`by` delegates behavior to another class. This is a nice way to implement an interface by delegating to another object injected through composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be careful with changing the object reference for a delegate. If you change it, Kotlin will keep using the old object when calling the delegate funcction. As a result you really shouldn't let the delegate object be updated (make it val)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Names with Backticks\n",
    "If you are using a method name that is a reserved kotlin keyword, such as Hamcrest's `is` method, then you can surround it with backticks to distinguish as a method name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infix Functions\n",
    "Using the `infix` keyword in a function definiton is a signal to the compiler to just inline the function where it is used during compile-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Destructuring Data Classes\n",
    "Data classes have componentN() methods added to the generated bytecode, which allows them to be automatically destructured into a list of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope Functions\n",
    "Combination of let with an elvis operator is pretty useful when you have a block of code to execute when a value is not null:\n",
    "```\n",
    "response?.let { \n",
    "    return response.someProp\n",
    "} ?: \"Some Default\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also is a way to run side effects as a result of an execution:\n",
    "```\n",
    "val jake = Person(\"Jake\", 30, \"Android developer\")\n",
    "    .also {\n",
    "        println(\"Created Jake\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With allows you to concisely access properties on an object (sort of an implicit `this`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several others\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "* Try compiling a Kotlin application with GraalVM\n",
    "* Try out delegation in a class"
