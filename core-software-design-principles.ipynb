    "# Core Software Design Principles\n",
    "This notebook contains my notes from the *Core Software Design Principles* session by Venkat Subramaniam at *UberConf 2019*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Venkat said he wanted this session to be about the \"time-tested software design principles\" that keep staying relevant over time as technologies change.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was pretty familiar with these principles already, but it's always good to review!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic vs Tactical Design\n",
    "Venkat said he likes to think of software design split into two major categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Design\n",
    "This type of design is the high-level design that is focused on major ideas. It includes package- and class-level design. Venkat said this type of design is very much not set in stone, it should be evolving over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tactical Design\n",
    "This type of design is the low-level details like methods and properties within a single class. He designs using the pattern of \"Test, stop and think, write design, and code\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Principles\n",
    "Venkat said that design principles, once understood by a team, are good ways to communicate with the team. He gave an example of simple comments he uses on code reviews like like \"Keep this DRY\" or \"YAGNI\", and his team immediately understands what he means.\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we evaluate code?\n",
    "* Cohesion - Want to be high (does one thing well)\n",
    "* Coupling - Want to be low\n",
    "\n",
    "Venkat then focused on several principles he considers to be most important in software design.\n",
    "#### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\n",
    "Every piece of knowledge should have a single source of representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't just apply to duplication of code, it also applies to duplication of effort. Venkat gave the example of a company doing validation on both frontend and backend systems, by different teams. While it is important to validate on the backend and desirable to validate on the front-end (for UX), it is a duplication of effort. He gave two suggestions for this particular case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code generation (e.g. Kotlin.js)\n",
    "2. AJAX calls from the front-end to backend services\n",
    "\n",
    "Venkat seems to be very firm on the principle of DRY: \"Never do anything more than twice that you don't enjoy doing\". By this logic, he said that manual testing instead of automated testing is a violation of the DRY principle. He also gave examples of even small things like manually turning on/off the WiFi or stopping/starting a server. He automates these things because they increase his flow from then on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)\n",
    "Focus on writing the code that is needed, not what might be needed later. He gave the example of writing mountains of validation code for cases that will most certainly never happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said something falls under YAGNI based on the cost of doing it now vs. the cost of doing is later. He gave the following formula:\n",
    "* $now > $later => Postpone until later\n",
    "* $now == $later => Postpone until later\n",
    "* $now < $later => What is the probability of needing that code? If high, do it now. If low, postpone until later\n",
    "\n",
    "He talked about the idea of the \"Last reponsible moment\". This is not procrastination; the last responsible moment is last moment before it becomes procrastination. He often modifies YAGNI to be *YAGNIy* - You ain't gonna need it (yet). Postpone things until the last responsible moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "He asked the audience \"What does single responsibility even mean\"? He cited an example of some code that was supposed to violate SRP:\n",
    "```\n",
    "process() {\n",
    "  shapes = getShapes()\n",
    "  transform(shapes)\n",
    "  display(shapes)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "He said if that violates SRP then every program anyone ever writes must violate SRP. He defined SRP to mean *cohesion*. It should be focused and do one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One enemy of SRP is long methods. Long methods are:\n",
    "* Hard to understand\n",
    "* Hard to maintain\n",
    "* Hard to debug\n",
    "* Hard to test\n",
    "* Destined to become even longer\n",
    "* Prone to duplication of code\n",
    "* Hard to reuse\n",
    "* Not cohesive and have high coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "How long is too long? It is hard for peopole to agree on a length. Venkat instead prefers to use *SLAP*: Single Level of Abstration Principle. A single method shouldn't have multiple levels of abstraction in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-Closed Principle\n",
    "\"Open for extension, but closed for modification\". Venkat gave the following bit of code as an example:"

    "He then gave the example of wanting to add a copy constructor to the above code, then also adding a new type of Engine (TurboEngine). After doing both these actions he had to write a type check in the Car copy constructor to see what Engine type he should use. This is a violation of OCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "His solution to this particular example was to make the copy constructor protected and call it from a clone() method on the object."

    "#### Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "Use inheritance only for substitutability and not for reuse. If an object of B wants to use an object of A, then use delegation. If an object of B should be used where an object of A is expected, then use inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality of a derived class should require no more and promise no less than the corresponding services of the base class. \"Am I honoring the written and implied contract of the inherited class?\" The compiler requires you to honor the written controct, but the implied contract is much harder to honor.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSP in Java: \n",
    "* Good examples:\n",
    "  * An instance method is not allowed to have a more restrictive privilege than the base\n",
    "  * An overriding method can't throw any new exception that the base method is not throwing\n",
    "* Bad examples:\n",
    "  * Stack extends Vector in the Java API, even though a Stack should not allow insertions in the middle but a Vector does.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "Depend on an interface and not on a class. Venkat gave the example of being in a hotel and being upset because he didn't have a clock. What he really wanted was the alarm functionality on his clock, which the TV in the room also had. He should have been depending on an alarm instead of a clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "As a result of attending this session, I would like to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continue focus on automating painful bits of my workflow. I liked his extending DRY to \"Never do anything more than twice that you don't enjoy doing\""
