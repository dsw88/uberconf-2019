    "# Core Software Design Principles\n",
    "Venkat Subramaniam\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Time-tested software design principles\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic design:\n",
    "* High-level design focused on major ideas (classes, packages, etc.)\n",
    "* Not set in stone, it should be evolving over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Tactical design:\n",
    "* Focused on low-level details (methods, properties, etc.)\n",
    "* Test, stop and think, write design and code\n",
    "\n",
    "Design principles, once understood by a team, are good ways to communicate with the team. Example of code review with comments like \"Keep this DRY\" and \"YAGNI\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How to evaluate code?\n",
    "* Cohesion - Want to be high (does one thing well)\n",
    "* Coupling - Want to be low\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Principles\n",
    "#### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\n",
    "Every piece of knowledge should have a single source of representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Not just applies to duplication of code, also applies to duplication of effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gave example of a company doing validation on both frontend and backend systems, by different teams. He gave two suggestions for this particular case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code generation (e.g. Kotlin.js)\n",
    "2. AJAX\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Never do anything more than twice that you don't enjoy doing\". Manual testing is a violation of the DRY principle. Gave example of even small things like manually turning on/off the WiFi or stopping/starting a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)\n",
    "Want to focus on writing code that is needed. Gave example of writing mountains of validation code for cases that will likely never happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost of writing code now vs later:\n",
    "* $now > $later => Postpone until later\n",
    "* $now == $later => Postpone until later\n",
    "* $now < $later => What is the probability of needing that code? High, now. Low, later\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Last reponsible moment\". Not procrastination; LRM is the last moment before it becomes procrastination. YAGNIy - You ain't gonna need it (yet) - Postpone until the last LRM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\"What does responsibility even mean\"? Example of this code that was supposed to violate SRP:\n",
    "```\n",
    "process() {\n",
    "  shapes = getShapes()\n",
    "  transform(shapes)\n",
    "  display(shapes)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "SRP == cohesion. It should be focused and do one thing\n",
    "\n",
    "Long methods:\n",
    "* Hard to understand\n",
    "* Hard to maintain\n",
    "* Hard to debug\n",
    "* Hard to test\n",
    "* Long methods become longer\n",
    "* Lead to duplication of code\n",
    "* Hard to reuse\n",
    "* Have low cohesion and high coupling (diagonal opposite of good design)\n",
    "\n",
    "How long is too long? Hard to agree on a length. SLAP: Single Level of Abstration Principle. Shouldn't have multiple levels of abstraction in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-Closed Principle\n",
    "Open for extension, but closed for modification"

    "#### Liskov Substitution Principle\n",

    "\n",

    "  * Example of Stack extending Vector in Java\n",
    "\n",
